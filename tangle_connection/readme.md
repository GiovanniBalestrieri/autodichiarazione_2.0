# Connection to Tangle, a decentralized network allowing peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries or fees. 

By using IOTA, you can build applications that benefit from the following:
-    Authenticity: Prove that you have sent a self-declaration
-    Integrity: Prove that your data is unchanged
-    Confidentiality: Control who has access to your data through encryption

## Trust:
All published self-declarations can be seen as valid transactions agreed on by all nodes, removing the need to trust a single entity in the network.

## Integrity
All transactions in the Tangle are immutable and transparent.
Each transaction references the transaction hashes of two previous ones. So, if the contents of any transaction were to change, the hashes would be invalid, making the transactions invalid.

## Security and privacy
IOTA uses quantum-robust one-time signatures to stop attackers from altering your self-declaration.
IOTA networks are peer-to-peer networks where no central authority controls the Tangle. Instead, all nodes hold a copy of it and reach a consensus on its contents.

## Cost saving
The Tangle is free to use. You don't need to pay a subscription, or sign a contract. Even transactions are feeless. You can store data on the Tangle with no restrictions.

## Scalability
For each transaction that's attached to the Tangle, two previous transactions are validated. This process makes IOTA incredibly scalable because more new transactions lead to faster validations.
